The project aims to analyze the Armenian car market, examine the buyers’ and seller’s
preferences, and compare it with the US car market.
The major dataset used in the project was scrapped from “haycar.am”, a web page for
publishing cars for sale. Another two datasets were taken from kaggle.com and used to
understand the differences between the native and foreign markets. One included data on
the Armenian car market; the next contained US car data.
During the research, three hypotheses will be driven and presented.
